# React.js Practice

## Things I Learned
1. Hello World using HTML
2. Same thing using JavaScript
3. Bringing React into code using CDN links
4. Writing React code in a separate JavaScript file
5. Creating React elements (objects)
6. Creating root in ReactDOM using `createRoot`
7. Assigning root in React
8. Rendering React components in the browser using `ReactDOM.render`
9. Using the `createElement` API:
   - Name of tag (e.g., `div`)
   - Attributes (e.g., `id`)
   - Content or children of the element

### Important Notes:
- If a root already exists, a new parent will replace it.
- React can only be manipulated and modified within its root.
- Consider updating the font and beautifying the markdown for GitHub README to enhance readability and presentation.
